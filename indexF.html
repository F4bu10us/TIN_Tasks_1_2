                The Boys
            </header>
            <section class="info">
                The Boys is set in a universe where superpowered people are recognized as
                heroes by the general public and owned by powerful corporation Vought International,
                which markets and monetizes them. Outside of their heroic personas, most are arrogant
                and corrupt. The series primarily focuses on two groups: the Seven, Vought International's
                premier superhero team, and the titular Boys, vigilantes looking to keep the corrupted heroes under control.

                The Boys are led by Billy Butcher, who despises all superpowered people,
                and the Seven are led by the egotistical and unstable Homelander. As a conflict
                ensues between the two groups, the series also follows the new members of each
                team: Hugh "Hughie" Campbell of the Boys, who joins the vigilantes after his
                girlfriend is killed by one of the Seven; and Annie January / Starlight of the
                Seven, a young and hopeful heroine forced to face the truth about the heroes she admires.
