    Covert redirect is a subtle method to perform phishing attacks that makes links
    appear legitimate, but actually redirect a victim to an attacker's website.
    The flaw is usually masqueraded under a log-in popup based on an affected site's
    domain.[35] It can affect OAuth 2.0 and OpenID based on well-known exploit
    parameters as well. This often makes use of open redirect and XSS vulnerabilities
    in the third-party application websites.

    [36] Users may also be redirected to
    phishing websites covertly through malicious browser extensions.[37]

    Normal phishing attempts can be easy to spot because the malicious page's URL
    will usually be different from the real site link. For covert redirect, an attacker
    could use a real website instead by corrupting the site with a malicious login
    popup dialogue box. This makes covert redirect different from others.[38][39]

    Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits.
    They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores.
    Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous
    and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within
    lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally
    fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians,

    reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry).
    Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group,
    it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it
    is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods.[1][2] The traditional term
    pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.

    For example, suppose a victim clicks a malicious phishing link beginning with
    Facebook. A popup window from Facebook will ask whether the victim would like
    to authorize the app. If the victim chooses to authorize the app, a "token" will
    be sent to the attacker and the victim's personal sensitive information could be
    exposed. These information may include the email address, birth date, contacts,
    and work history.[36] In case the "token” has greater privilege, the attacker
    could obtain more sensitive information including the mailbox, online presence,
    and friends list. Worse still, the attacker may possibly control and operate the
    user’s account.[40] Even if the victim does not choose to authorize the app,
    he or she will still get redirected to a website controlled by the attacker.
    This could potentially further compromise the victim.[41]

    This vulnerability was discovered by Wang Jing, a Mathematics Ph.D. student at
    School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences in Nanyang Technological University
    in Singapore.[42] Covert redirect is a notable security flaw, though it is not a
    threat to the Internet worth significant attention.[43]
    The term whaling refers to spear phishing attacks directed specifically at senior
    executives and other high-profile targets.[15] In these cases, the content will
    be crafted to target an upper manager and the person's role in the company.
    The content of a whaling attack email may be an executive issue such as a
    subpoena or customer complaint.[16]

    Fish can communicate in their underwater environments through the use of acoustic
    communication. Acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission of acoustic
    signals from one individual of a species to another. The production of sounds as a
    means of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding,
    aggression or courtship behaviour.[5] The sounds emitted by fish can vary depending
    on the species and stimulus involved. They can produce either stridulatory sounds
    by moving components of the skeletal system, or can produce non-stridulatory sounds
    by manipulating specialized organs such as the swimbladder.[6]

    Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic
    environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal
    and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish),
    although no species has yet been documented in the deepest 25% of the ocean.
    With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any
    other group of vertebrates.[7][8]

    Fish are an important resource for humans worldwide, especially as food. Commercial
    and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries (see fishing) or farm them in
    ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquaculture). They are also caught by
    recreational fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, and exhibited in public
    aquaria. Fish have had a role in culture through the ages, serving as deities,
    religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies.
